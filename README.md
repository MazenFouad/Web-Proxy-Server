# Python Web Proxy Server

The Python Web Proxy Server is a lightweight proxy server implemented in Python that allows users to intercept and forward HTTP requests and responses between clients and servers. This proxy server can be used for various purposes, such as caching, filtering, or enhancing privacy.

## Features

- HTTP Proxy: Handles HTTP requests and responses, allowing clients to communicate with web servers.
- Request Modification: Intercept and modify requests before forwarding them to the target server.
- Response Modification: Intercept and modify responses before sending them back to the client.
- Caching: Implement a caching mechanism to store and serve cached responses for improved performance.
- Filtering: Implement filters to restrict access to certain websites or content.
- Logging: Record and log incoming and outgoing requests for analysis or debugging purposes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries: [list any additional libraries or dependencies].

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/python-web-proxy-server).
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Customize the proxy server configuration in the `config.py` file to meet your specific needs.

## Usage

1. Run the proxy server by executing `python proxy_server.py` in your terminal.
2. Set the proxy settings in your client application or web browser to point to the running proxy server (default port: 8080).
3. Access web resources through the configured proxy server, which will intercept and forward requests and responses accordingly.
4. Monitor the proxy server logs for incoming and outgoing traffic.

Please note that the use of a web proxy server should comply with local laws, regulations, and ethical considerations. Ensure you understand and respect the legal and privacy implications of using such a server.
